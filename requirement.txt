Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that software developers encounter. They represent best practices that can be applied in different situations to improve the design of code. Design patterns can be categorized into three main types:

### 1. **Creational Patterns**
   - **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
   - **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
   - **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
   - **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
   - **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

### 2. **Structural Patterns**
   - **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
   - **Bridge**: Separates an object’s interface from its implementation so that both can vary independently.
   - **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
   - **Decorator**: Adds additional responsibilities to an object dynamically without altering its structure.
   - **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
   - **Flyweight**: Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects by sharing as much data as possible.
   - **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

### 3. **Behavioral Patterns**
   - **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes a request along a chain of handlers. Each handler can either process the request or pass it to the next handler.
   - **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization and queuing of requests, and supporting undoable operations.
   - **Interpreter**: Defines a grammatical representation for a language and an interpreter to deal with this grammar.
   - **Iterator**: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
   - **Mediator**: Reduces coupling between classes by using a mediator object to handle communication between them.
   - **Memento**: Captures and externalizes an object’s internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.
   - **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
   - **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
   - **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
   - **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses.
   - **Visitor**: Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure, allowing new operations to be defined without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

### Usage in Practice
Design patterns are language-agnostic and can be implemented in various programming languages. They help developers create more flexible, reusable, and maintainable code by addressing common design challenges.
